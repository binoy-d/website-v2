is the second version of my personal portfolio website. The previous version of this website was done working off of a bootstrap template, with major customizations done down the line. It was a great learning experience for me, but after some time I felt unsatisfied with it. I decided to do a complete overhaul of the site, both visually and behind the scenes.\n I started by listing every issue I had with version 1. These included being too "bootstrappy", lacking a single cohesive color scheme, irrelevant pages, bloat, and parts  breaking on mobile. From there, I started learning React following a course on LinkedIn Learning. Using what I learned, I started building and rebuilding the website. I iterated through many different layouts, color schemes, and component tree structures until I arrived at this one. I used libraries such as react-reveal react-particles-js, and more to achieve many of the effects. Overall, this has been a great learning experience for me, and I will continue to update it.

I started out wanting to make some sort of simple music visualizer that works using perlin noise. However, as we added more and more to the visual, it ended up resulting in a wild visual experience. Adding mouse and keyboard interaction made it even more interesting. By using WASD to move around, QE to zoom in and out, and ZX to increase and decrease number of strands, the user can create complex visuals. Some of my favorites include shapes that act like a jellyfish, mushroom, and even one that looked like an iris. This was my first time working with webgl in p5.js."},{title:"Bubbles, Together",description:["Users draw together live, with bubbles","Particle effects and graphics done with p5.js","Capable of handling many concurrent users"],languages:["p5.js","Node","JavaScript","SocketIO","Heroku"],link:"https://bubbles-together.herokuapp.com/",img:c,featured:!1,codeLink:"https://github.com/binoy-d/particle-draw2",longDescription:"I have always loved simple, beautiful particle effects.Any user that visits this website can generate randomly colored bubbles by clicking and dragging their mouse around the screen. All users who are on the site at the same time can also see eachother's bubbles. This makes for a fun, interactive shared experience for  users as they play around drawing shapes and often writing things in bubbles The front end as well as all particle effects are done using p5.js, a port of Processing to JavaScript. The backend is a NodeJS server using SocketIO to communicate. Interestingly, the only data I send back and forth is the mouse positions. The bubble creation is handled on the front end for speed purposes. This means that though each client gets roughly the sameview, there will be slight differences as each client generates their ownversion of the current state."},{title:"Puzzle Game",description:["Turn based puzzle game with retro aesthetic","Written purely with Java and standard libraries","Reads custom map files as matrix of tiles"],languages:["Java","Graphics2D"],link:"https://github.com/binoy-d/2p1p-puzzle-game",img:d,featured:!1,codeLink:"https://github.com/binoy-d/2p1p-puzzle-game",longDescription:'A puzzle game I made as a sophomore.

The 2020 theme was "repair", and we brainstormed many ideas before settling on the concept of fixing code. Often times, programmers do what is called "rubber duck debugging" in which one explains their problems to a rubber duck to help think through it.  In the game, you play as the rubber duck, solving your programmer\'s bugs. As you fix more bugs, the game fixes itself by changing its own mechanics. As the programmer relies more and more on your fixing, he begins bringing up problems in his personal life as well, and it becomes your job to solve those as well by changing negative thoughts into healthy ones. The game can be described as a TDS interactive fiction experience.'},{title:"Tankmania",description:["Tank war simulator project","User can pick number of teams and tanks per team","3-stage AI that
